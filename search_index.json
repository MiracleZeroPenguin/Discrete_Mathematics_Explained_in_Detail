Truth Table 真值表\n真值表是研究命题逻辑的重要工具\n在构建真值表时，其实就是在手工模拟计算机枚举的过程\n不难，仅以一题为例\n\nAn island has two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You go to the island and meet A and B. \nA says “B is a knight.”\nB says “The two of us are of opposite types.”\nWhat are the types of A and B?\n\nLet  p:  \"A is a knight\"\n​       q:  \"B is a knight\" \n\n\n\np\nq\np ↔ q\nq ↔ p ⊕ q\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nF\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nF\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n\nSo the answer is that both A and B are knaves.\n1.4. Equivalent Propositions 等价命题\nTwo propositions are equivalent if they always have the same truth value.\n1.4.1. Two Related Problems\nHow many rows are there in a truth table with npropositional variables?\n2^n\nWith n propositional variables, we can construct ( ) distinct (i.e., not equivalent) propositions\n2^{2^n}\n稍加解释一下，有n个命题变量时，真值表就有了2^n种情况，而每一个命题对于每一种情况，它都可以有T和F两个值（注意，如果两个命题在这2^n个情况之下真值完全相同，则它们被视为完全等价的两个命题，即在这里被算为一个）那么此时，就有了2^{2^n}种不同的真值组合，对应2^{2^n}种不同的命题\n1.5. Bit Operations 位运算\n\nBit: a symbol with two possible values , namely, 0 and 1.\nBoolean variable: one whose value is either true or false.\nA bit string is a sequence of zero or more bits\nBitwise operations are bit operations extended to bit strings. （按位X）\n\n2.

Contradictions 永假 （矛盾式）\nA  contradiction is a proposition which is always false.\ne.g. p ∧ ¬p\n2.1.3. Contingencies 可能式\nA  contingency is a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction, such as  p\n2.2. Logical Equivalences 逻辑等价式\nThe compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent if p ↔ q is a tautology.\n2.2.1. Notation 记号\np ⇔ q or p ≡ q\n\nRemark\nThe symbol ≡ is not a logical connective, and p ≡ q is not a compound proposition but rather is the statement that p ↔ q is a tautology.\n\n2.3.

Quantifications of Two Variables 两个变量的量化式 Chapter 01 Logic and Proofs 逻辑与证明\n\nPart 02\nCovering1.4 ~ 1.5\n\n1. Predicate Logic 谓词逻辑\n1.1. Predicate and Quantifiers 谓词和量词的概念\n1.1.1. Predicate 谓词\nA predicate (propositional function 命题函数) is a statement that contains variables. \nOnce the values of the variables are specified, the function has a truth value.\nP(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) n-place (n-ary) predicate n位谓词（n元谓词）\n1.1.2. Quantifiers 量词\nWe need quantifiersto express the meaning of English words including all and some.\nUniversal Quantifier 全称量词\n\"For all\"\n∀\n∀x P(x) is read as \"For all x, P(x)\" or \"For every x, P(x)\"\n\nThe universal quantification of P(x) create a proposition from a propositional function.\n\nExistential Quantifier 存在量词\n\"There exists\"\n∃\n∃x P(x) is read as \"For some x, P(x)\", or as \"There is an xsuch that P(x)\", or \"For at least one x, P(x).\"\nProperties of Quantifiers 量词性质\n\n\n\nStatement\nWhen true?\nWhen false?\n\n\n\n\n\\forall x P(x)\nP(x) is true for every x.\nThere is an x for which P(x) is false.\n\n\n\\exists x P(x)\nThere is an x for which P(x) is true.\nP(x) is false for every x.\n\n\n\nThinking about Quantifiers 深入理解量词\nLoop 循环\nWhen the domain of discourse is finite, we can think of quantification as looping through the elements of the domain.\n\nTo evaluate ∀x P(x) loop through all x in the domain\n\nIf at every step P(x) is true, then ∀x P(x) is true\n\nIf at a step P(x) is false, then ∀x P(x) is false and the loop terminates\n\nTo evaluate ∃x P(x) loop through all xin the domain\n\nIf at some step, P(x) is true, then ∃x P(x) is true and the loop terminates\n\nIf the loop ends without finding an xfor which P(x) is true, then ∃x P(x) is false\n\n\nEven if the domains are infinite, we can still think of the quantifiers this fashion, but the loops will not terminate in some cases.\n\nConjunctions and Disjunctions 合取、析取\nIf the domain is finite, a universally quantified proposition is equivalent to a conjunction of propositions without quantifiers and an existentially quantified proposition is equivalent to a disjunction of propositions without quantifiers.\nIf U consists of the integers 1,2, and 3\n\\forall x P(x)\\equiv P(1)\\wedge P(2)\\wedge P(3)\n\\exists x P(x)\\equiv P(1)\\vee P(2)\\vee P(3)\n\nEven if the domains are infinite, you can still think of the quantifiers in this fashion, but the equivalent expressions without quantifiers will be infinitely long.\n\nOther Quantifiers 其他量词\n Uniqueness quantifier 唯一性量词\n\\exists! or \\exists_1\n∃!x P(x) means that P(x) is true for one and only one x in the universe of discourse.\nPrecedence of Quantifiers 量词优先级\nThe quantifiers ∀and ∃have higher precedence than all the logical operators.\nBinding Variables 量词绑定\nBound Variable 约束的量词\na variable is bound if it is known or quantified.\nFree Variable 自由的量词\na variable neither quantified nor specified with a value\n\nAll the variables that occur in a propositional function must be bound or set equal to a particular value to turn it into a proposition.\nIn the statement ∃x(x + y = 1), the variable x is bound by the existential quantification ∃x, but the variable y is free because it is not bound by a quantifier and no value is assigned to this variable. This illustrates that in the statement ∃x(x + y = 1), x is bound, but y is free.\nHowever, this statement is not a proposition since y is undefined and we can't tell whether it is true or false.\n\n1.2.

Translating from English into Logical Expressions\nThe very first step is to decide on the domain U.\n\nTranslate the following sentence into predicate logic\n“Every student in this class has taken a course in Java.”\nFirst decide on the domain U.\nSolution 1\nIf U is all students in this class, define a propositional function J(x) denoting “x has taken a course in Java” and translate as ∀x J(x).\nSolution 2\nBut if U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class” and translate as ∀x (S(x)→ J(x)).\n\n1.4.1. A Very Important Notice!!!\n\nEvery student in this class has taken a course in Java\nif U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class”\n\\forall x(S(x)\\wedge J(x)) is not correct!!!\nif there is one x that does not belong to this class, then the whole statement is false!\n\nSome student in this class has taken a course in Java\nif U is all people\n\\exists x(S(x)\\to J(x)) is not correct!!!\nif there is one x that does not brlong to this class, the the whole statement is true!\n\n\n1.5. Premises and Conclusion 前提和结论\nLewis Carroll Example\nAn argument\n\n“All lions are fierce.”\n“Some lions do not drink coffee.”\n“Some fierce creatures do not drink coffee.”\n\nThe first two are called premises（前提） and the third is called the conclusion（结论）.The entire set is called an argument（论证）.\nOne way to translate these statements to predicate logic\nLet p(x), q(x), and r(x) be the propositional functions “xis a lion,” “xis fierce,” and “xdrinks coffee,” respectively. Domain of x: All creatures.\n\n∀x (p(x)→ q(x))\n∃x (p(x) ∧¬r(x))\n∃x (q(x) ∧¬r(x))\n\nLater we will see how to prove that the conclusion follows from the premises.\n2. Nested Quantifiers 嵌套量词\n2.1. Definition 定义\nTwo quantifiers are nested if one is within the scope of the other.\ne.g. \\forall x\\exists yC(x,y)\n2.2. Translating from Nested Quantifiers into English\n\nTranslate the statement \\forall x(C(x)\\wedge \\exists y(C(y)\\wedge F(x,y))) into English, where C(x) is \"x has a computer,\" F(x,y) is \"x and y are friends,\" and the domain for both x and y consists of all students at ZJU. \nSolution\n\nUse variables in the translatint result (Easy and clear)\nFor every student x at ZJU, x has a computer or there is a student y such that y has a computer and x and y are friends.\n\nUnderstand the meaning and report it in English\nEvery student at ZJU has a computer or has a friend who has a computer.\n\n\n\n2.3. Translating English into Logical Expressions Involving Nested Quantifiers\n\nExpress the statement “Everyone has exactly one best friend” as a logical expression with a domain consisting of all people\nSolution\nRewrite the original statement as For every person x , x has exactly one best friend.\nThere is a person y who is the best friend of x, and furthermore, that for every person z, if z is not y, then z is not the best friend of x.\nLet B(x, y) be the statement y is the best friend of x.\n\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z(B(x,y)\\wedge((z≠y)\\to\\neg B(x,z)))\n\n2.4.

Rules of Inference 推理规则\n\nProofs in mathematics are valid arguments\nAn argument（论证） is a sequence of statements that end with a conclusion\nBy valid（有效性）, we mean the conclusion must follow from the truth of the preceding statements (premises（前提）)\n\n1.1. Valid Arguments in Propositional Logic 命题逻辑的有效论证\nAn argument in propositional logic is a sequence of  propositions. \nAll but the final proposition in the argument are called premises and the final proposition is called the conclusion. \nAn argument is valid if the truth of all its premises implies that the conclusion is true.\nAn argument form（论证形式） in propositional logic is a sequence of compound propositions involving propositional variables.\nAn argument form is valid if no matter which particular propositions are substituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true. \np_1\\\\p_2\\\\...\\\\p_n\\\\-\\\\\\therefore q\nAn argument in propositional logic is valid when its argument form is valid.\ne.g.\n\n1.2.

Many of these programs make use of a rule of inference known as resolution. This rule of inference is based on the tautology\n\n((p\\vee q)\\wedge (\\neg p\\vee r))\\to(q\\vee r)\nThe final disjunction in the resolution rule, q\\vee r, is called the resolvent（消解式）\n\nResolution is very important in AI!\n\n1.2.2.

Fallacies 谬误\nSeveral common fallacies arise in incorrect arguments. These fallacies resemble rules of inference,\nbut are based on contingencies rather than tautologies.\n1.4.1.

Introduction to Proofs 证明导论\n\nThe construction of a valid proof is an art, honed after much practice.\n\n2.1. Some Terminology 一些专业术语\nA proof（证明） is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement\nA theorem（定理） (proposition（命题）/fact（事实）/result（结论）) is a statement that can be shown to be true\nAxioms（公理） (postulates（假设）) are statements we assume to be true\nA lemma（引理） is a less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results\nA corollary（推论） is a theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that has been proved\nA conjecture（猜想） is a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement\n\nA conjecture becomes a theorem once it has been proved to be true\n\n2.2. Understanding How Theorems Are Stated 理解定理是如何陈述的\n2.2.1. Implied Universal Quantifiers 隐含全称量词\ne.g.\n“if x>y, where x and y are positive real numbers, then x^2>y^2​.”\nFor all positive real numbers x and y, if x>y, then x^2>y^2​.\n2.2.2. Implicit Implications 暗示关系\ne.g.\n“The square of an odd integer is odd.”\n“if an integer n is odd, then n^2 is odd.”\n “For all integer n, if n is odd, then n^2 is odd.”\n2.3. Methods of Proving Theorems 证明方法\n2.3.1. Formal Proofs 形式化证明\n\nCan be extremely long\n\nMay be hard to follow\n\n\n2.3.2. Informal Proofs 非形式化证明\n\nEach step may involve multiple rules of inference;\n\nSteps may be skipped;\n\nThe axioms being assumed and the rules of inference used are not explicitly stated. \n\n\n2.4. Mistakes in Proofs 证明中的错误\nMany mistakes result from the introduction of steps that do not logically follow from those that precede it.\nMany incorrect arguments are based on a fallacy called begging the question (circular reasoning（循环论证）)\n3. Proof Methods 证明方法\n3.1. Direct Proofs 直接证明\nA direct proof shows that a conditional statement p → q is true by showing that if p is true, then q must also be true\n3.2. Indirect Proofs 间接证明\n3.2.1. Proof by Contraposition 反证法\nP\\to Q\\equiv\\neg Q\\to\\neg P\nVacuous Proof 空证明\nIf we know P is false then  P → Q is vacuously true.\nF → T and F → F are both true.\n\ne.g. If Tom is both handsome and ugly then he feels unhappy.\n\nTrivial Proof 平凡证明\nIf we know Q is true, then P → Q is trivially true\nF → T and T → T are both true.\n\ne.g. If it’s raining today then the empty set is a subset of every set.\n\n3.2.2. Proof by Contradiction 归谬证明法\n\\neg p\\to(q\\wedge\\neg q)\n直接的说，就是先假设p为假，然后推出两个相矛盾的结论\n它与反证法的差别就在于反证法是找到与假设相悖的结论，而归谬证明法是由假设推出两个相悖的结论，即矛盾的产生处不同\n\nExample:\nProve there is no largest prime number.\nProof:\nLet p be the proposition “there is no largest prime number.”\nAssume that ¬p is true, namely, there is a largest prime number, denoted by s.\nHence, the set of all primes lie between 2 and s. \nForm the product of these primes:\n\r\n> r=2×3×5×7×11×…×s\r\n> \nBut r + 1 is a prime or has a prime factor larger than s. \nThis is a contradiction since we have shown that ¬p implies both q and ¬q where q is the statement that s is the largest prime number.\nHence, ¬p is false, so that p, “there is no largest prime number,” is true. \nQ.E.D.\n\nProof  p → q by Contradiction 运用归谬证明法证明蕴含关系\n\nassumes that both p and ¬q are true\n\nshows that (p\\wedge\\neg q)\\to F\n\n\nProofs of Equivalence by Contradiction 运用归谬证明法的等价证明法\np\\leftrightarrow q\\equiv(p\\to q)\\wedge(q\\to p)\n[p_1\\leftrightarrow p_2\\leftrightarrow...p_n]\\equiv[(p_1\\to p_2)\\wedge(p_2\\to p_3)\\wedge...\\wedge(p_n\\to p_1)]\n3.2.3. Counterexamples 反例证明法\nWhen presented with a statement of the form ∀xP(x), which we believe to be false or which has resisted all proof attempts, we look for a counterexample.\n3.3. Proof by Cases 分情形证明法\n就是分类讨论\nNotice:\nYou have to ——\n\nConvince the reader that the cases are inclusive (i.e., they exhaust all possibilities)\nEstablish all implications\n\n\nExample:\nProve that if n is an integer not divisible by 2 or 3, then n2-1 is divisible by 24.\nSolution:\n\nn = 6k+1\n\nn = 6k+5\n\n\n\n3.4. Exhaustive Proof 穷举证明法\nAn exhaustive proof is a special type of proof by cases where each case involves checking a single example\n\nExample:\nShow that there are no solutions in integers x and y of x^2 + 3y^2=8\n\r\n> x = -2,-1,0,1,2\r\n> \n\r\n> y = -1,0,1\r\n> \nBy exhausting every possible situation, we can draw the conclusion that this pair of x and y does not exist.\n\n3.5. Existence Proof 存在性证明\n3.5.1. Constructive Existence Proof 构造性证明\n\nEstablish P(c) is true for some c in the domain\nThen ∀xP(x) is true by Existential Generalization (EG)\n\n\nExample:\nShow that there are n consecutive composite positive integers for every positive integer n\nExplanation:\n\\forall n\\exists x((x+i)\\ is\\ composite\\ for\\ i\\ = 1,2,...,n)\nProof:\nLet x = (n + 1)! + 1.\nConsider the integers x + 1, x + 2, … , x + n. \nNote that i + 1 divides x + i = (n + 1)! + (i + 1)\\ for\\ i = 1, 2, … , n​\nHence, n consecutive composite positive integers have been given. \nQ.E.D.\n\n3.5.2. Nonconstructive Existence Proof 非构造性证明\nAssume no c exists which makes P(c) true and derive a contradiction \n\nExample:\nProve that for all integers n, there exists a prime p so that p > n\nProof:\nLet n be an arbitrary integer, and consider n! + 1.  \n\nIf (n! + 1) is prime, we are done since (n! + 1) > n.  \n\nBut what if (n! + 1) is composite?\nIf (n! + 1) is composite then it has a prime factorization:\n\r\n>   p_1×p_2×…×p_k=(n!+1)\r\n>   \nConsider the smallest p_1, it is still larger than n\nLet p = p_1 , then  p > n, and we are done.  \n\n\nQ.E.D.\nNote:\nWE STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT p IS!!!\n\n3.6. Uniqueness Proof 唯一性证明\nThere are two parts of a uniqueness proof:\n\nExistence: We show that an element x with the desired property exists.\nUniqueness : We show that if y¹x, then y does not have the desired property. Equivalently, we can also show that if x and y both have the desired property, then x=y.\n\n\nExample:\nShow that if a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0, then there is a unique real number r such that ar+b=0\nProof:\n\nExistence:  Note that the real number r = -b/a is a solution of ar + b = 0 because a(-b/a)+b=-b+b=0. Thus, a real number r exists for which ar + b = 0.\n\nUniqueness: suppose that s is a real number such that as + b = 0. Then as + b = ar + b, where r = -b/a. Subtracting b from both sides, we find that as = ar. Dividing both sides of this last equation by a, which is nonzero, we see that s = r. \n\n\nQ.E.D. \n\n4. Proof Strategies 证明策略\n4.1. Forward Reasoning 正向推理\nUsing  premises, together with axioms and known theorems to lead to the conclusion. \n\nExample:\nGiven two distinct positive real numbers x and y, their arithmetic mean is (x+y)/2 and their geometric mean is \\sqrt{xy}, the arithmetic mean is always greater than the geometric mean.\nNote:\nif you start from (x+y)^2≥0, then it's forward reasoning\nif you start from (x+y)/2>\\sqrt{xy}, which is the conclusion, then it's backward reasoning, the strategy which we will talk about right below here.\n\n4.2. Backward Reasoning 反向推理\nTo reason backward to prove a statement q, we find a statement p that we can prove with the property that p → q.\n\nExample:\nSuppose that two people play a game taking turns removing, 1, 2, or 3 stones at a time from a pile that begins with 15 stones. The person who removes the last stone wins the game. Show that the first player can win the game no matter what the second player does.\nProof:\n\nStep n   : Player1 can win if the pile contains 1,2, or 3 stones. \n\nStep n-1: Player2 will have to leave such a pile if the pile that he/she is faced with has 4 stones. \n\nStep n-2: Player1  can leave 4 stones when there are 5,6, or 7 stones left at the beginning of his/her turn. \n\nStep n-3: Player2  must leave  such a pile, if there are  8 stones.\n\nStep n-4: Player1 has to have a pile with 9,10, or 11 stones to ensure that there are 8 left. \n\nStep n-5: Player2  needs to be faced with  12 stones to be forced to leave 9,10, or 11. \n\nStep n-6: Player1  can leave  12 stones by removing 3 stones. \nNow reasoning forward, the first player can ensure a win by removing 3 stones and leaving 12.\n\n\n\n"},"CH02_Basic_Structures/CH02_01_Set.html":{"url":"CH02_Basic_Structures/CH02_01_Set.html","title":"01 Set","keywords":"","body":"1.

Show that $|P(Z^+)|=|R|$\n\nFirst, for any S\\in P(Z^+), there is a real number r in (0,1) whose decimal expansion is\nr=0.d_1d_2d_3...\nd_i=\r\n  \\begin{cases}\r\n  6& i\\in S\\\\\r\n  7& i \\notin S\\\\\r\n  \\end{cases}\nThen we have constructed a one-to-one function from P(Z^+)​ to (0, 1)\n\nSecond, for any r in (0,1), it has a binary expansion r=0.d_1d_2d_3...​ \nThen there is a set \\{i|d_i=1\\}\nSo we constructed a one-to-one function from (0, 1) to P(Z^+)\n\nP.S.\nIn order that our function from (0, 1) to P(Z^+) to be well-defined, we must choose which of two equivalent expressions to represent numbers thath ave terminating binary expansions to use (for example, 0.10010\\overline1 versus 0.10011\\overline0​); we can decide to always use the terminating form, the one ending in all 0’s.)\n\n\nBy the Schrőder-Bernstein theorem we have |P(Z^+)|=|(0,1)|=|R|=c​\n\nHence, c=2^{\\aleph_0}\n\n2. Show that $|Z^+|\n\nCantor’s theorem\nThe cardinality of the power set of an arbitrary set has a greater cardinality than the original arbitrary set\n\nProof:\nStep 1\n\n We convert this problem into showing that there does not exist an onto function f from S to P(S)\n\nSuppose that f is a function from S to P(S). We must show that f is not onto.\nLet T=\\{s\\in S|s\\notin f(s)\\}. Although T is in the codomian of f, which is P(S), we will show that T is not in the range of f.\nIf it were, then we would have f(t) = T for some t\\in S\n\nSuppose that t\\in T, then according to the definition of T, t\\notin f(t), thus, t\\notin T, which is a contradiction\nSuppose that t\\notin T, then t\\notin f(t), then t follows the definition of T, so t\\in T, which is again a contradiction\n\nHence, f is not onto. \nIn other words, there does not exist an onto function f from S to P(S)\nStep 2\nThe function sending x to {x} for each x\\in S is a one-to-one function from S to P(S), hence |S|\\leq|P(S)|\nStep 3\nSince there is no onto from S to P(S), then there is no one-to-one correspondence, which implies that |S|\\neq|P(S)|\nAll in All\n|S|\n\n\nHence, by the Cantor’s theorem, |Z^+|, which can be expressed as \\aleph_0\n3. The Hypothesis\nThe famous continuum hypothesis asserts that there is no cardinal number X between \\aleph_0 and c\nIt tells us that the smallest infinite cardinal numbers forms an infinite sequence \\aleph_0,\\aleph_1,\\aleph_2,\\aleph_3,...\nThere are no other cardinal numbers between \\aleph_n and \\aleph_{n+1}, also \\aleph_ {n+1}is the cardinal number of the power set of a set S, whose own cardinal is \\aleph_n\nWhen we talk about \\aleph_0 and \\aleph_1, the continuum hypothesis (CH) asserts that there is no cardinal number （基数） a such that \\aleph_0\nHence, c=2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1\n"},"CH03_Algorithms/CH03_01_Algorithms.html":{"url":"CH03_Algorithms/CH03_01_Algorithms.html","title":"01 Algorithms","keywords":"","body":"1.

Definition 定义\nAn algorithm is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.\nPseudocode（伪代码）: Instructions given in a generic language similar to a computer language such as C++ or Pascal.\ne.g. A pseudocode description of the algorithm for finding the maximum element in a finite sequence follows.\nprocedure  max(a1, a2, ..., an :integers)\nmax := a1\nfor i := 2 to n\n    if max \n2. Properties 属性\n\nInput : An algorithm has input values from a specified set.\n\nOutput : From each set of input values, an algorithm produces output values from a specified set.\n\nDefiniteness : The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.\n\nCorrectness : An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of  input values.\n\nFiniteness : An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite number of steps for any input in the set.\n\nEffectiveness: Each step of an algorithm must be executed exactly and in a finite amount of time.\n\nGenerality : The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a particular set of input values.\n\n\n3.

Asymptotic Running Time 渐进运行时间\nA rough measurement of the running  time of an algorithm based on the input size\n\nGives you the relative rate of growth but not specific time of execution\n\nAllows for comparison of algorithms without implementation\n\nNot hardware specific\n\n\nAsymptotic running time : the number of operations used by the algorithm as the input size approaches infinity\n5.2. Big-O Notation 大O记号\n“f(x) is O(g(x))” if there are constants C and k such that |f(x)| ≤ C| g(x)| whenever x > k.\nThe constants C and k in the definition of big-O notation are called witnesses（凭证） to the relationship f (x) is O(g(x)).\n\n\n\nEquivalent expressions: f(x)=O(g(x)) f(x)\\in O(g(x))\nThe pair (C,k) is never unique\nWhen f(x) is O(g(x)) , and h(x) is a function that has larger absolute values than g(x) does for sufficiently large values of x, it follows that f(x) is O(h(x)) \n\n\n\n\nIf we have two standards, then two functions f(x) and g(x) that satisfy both of these big-O relationships are of the same order.\nif a is the Big-O of b, then b grows faster.\n\n5.2.1. Some Important Big-O Results\nLet f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0, where a_i(i=1,2,3,...) are real numbers, then f(x) is O(x^n)\n\n\n5.3. Growth of Combinations of Functions\n5.3.1. Addition of functions\nIf f_1(x) is O(g_1(x)) and  f_2(x) is O(g_2(x)), then  (f_1+f_2)(x)  is  O(max(g_1(x),g_2(x)))\n5.3.2. Multiplication of functions\nIf f_1(x) is O(g_1(x)) and  f_2(x) is O(g_2(x)), then (f_1f_2)(x) is O(g_1(x)g_2(x))\n5.4. Big-Omega and Big-Theta Notation\nf(x) is \\Omega(g(x)) if there are constants C and k such that |f(x)|\\geq C|g(x)| whenever x > k.\n\nf(x) is \\Theta(g(x)) if f(x) is O(g(x)) and f(x) is \\Omega(g(x))\n\nf(x) is \\Theta(g(x)) when there are real numbers C_1 and C_2 and a positive real number k such that\nC_1|g(x)|\\leq|f(x)|\\leq C_2|g(x)|\n\n\n6.

Understanding the complexity of algorithm\nTractable（易解的）: A problem is solvable using an algorithm with polynomial worst-case complexity. \nIntractable（难解的）: A problem cannot be solved using an algorithm with worst-case polynomial time complexity.\nSolvable（可解）\nUnsolvable（不可解）: Some problems even exist for which it can be shown that no algorithm exists for solving them. \n7.1. P&NP\nClass P（P类问题）: tractable problems\nClass NP (nondeterministic polynomial time（非确定性多项式时间）)（NP类）: problems for which a solution can be checked in polynomial time. \nNP-complete（NP完全问题）:  an important class of problems with the property that if any of these problems can be solved by a polynomial worst-case time algorithm, then all can be solved by polynomial worst-case time algorithms.\nThe P versus NP problem（P与NP问题） asks whether NP, the class of problems for which it is possible\nto check solutions in polynomial time, equals P, the class of tractable problems.
